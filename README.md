# Genetic
Some simple cases of Genetic Algorithms being put to use to solve basic problems. For word finding, we generate a few thousand 
agents who guess at a secret word. We breed/thin the herd based on how close they are to the actual string, and proceed through 
many generations until the agents evolve and converge at the correct solution. Maze solver is similar, but fitness is determined 
by how far along the maze the agent goes.
